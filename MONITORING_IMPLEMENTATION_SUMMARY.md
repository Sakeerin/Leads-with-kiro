# Monitoring and Deployment Infrastructure Implementation Summary

## Task 21: Set up monitoring and deployment infrastructure

### âœ… Completed Components

#### 1. Application Performance Monitoring and Alerting
- **MonitoringService** (`backend/src/services/monitoringService.ts`)
  - Custom metrics collection and recording
  - Performance timing with start/end timer methods
  - Express middleware for automatic request monitoring
  - Alert rules engine with configurable thresholds
  - Health metrics aggregation (requests/min, response time, error rate)
  - Memory usage and system metrics tracking

#### 2. Centralized Logging with Structured Log Format
- **LoggingService** (`backend/src/services/loggingService.ts`)
  - Winston-based structured logging with JSON format
  - Multiple log levels (info, warn, error, debug)
  - Business operation logging (lead operations, user actions)
  - Security event logging with audit trails
  - Performance logging for slow operations
  - Request/response logging middleware
  - File rotation and retention policies

#### 3. Health Check Endpoints for All Services
- **HealthCheckService** (`backend/src/services/healthCheckService.ts`)
  - Comprehensive health checks for database, Redis, Elasticsearch
  - Kubernetes-compatible readiness and liveness probes
  - Response time monitoring and degraded status detection
  - System resource monitoring (memory, CPU usage)
  - Prometheus metrics endpoint for scraping

- **Health Routes** (`backend/src/routes/health.ts`)
  - `/health` - Full health check with detailed status
  - `/health/ready` - Kubernetes readiness probe
  - `/health/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe
  - `/ping` - Simple availability check
  - `/metrics` - Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint

#### 4. Automated Deployment Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)
  - Multi-stage pipeline: test â†’ security-scan â†’ build â†’ deploy
  - Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
  - Security scanning with npm audit and Snyk
  - Docker image building and registry push
  - Staging and production deployment workflows
  - Automated rollback on deployment failure

- **Docker Configuration**
  - Multi-stage Dockerfile for backend with security optimizations
  - Nginx-based frontend container with performance tuning
  - Health checks integrated into Docker containers
  - Non-root user execution for security

#### 5. Kubernetes Deployment Configuration
- **K8s Manifests** (`k8s/`)
  - Namespace isolation (`k8s/namespace.yml`)
  - Backend deployment with rolling updates (`k8s/backend-deployment.yml`)
  - Frontend deployment with load balancing (`k8s/frontend-deployment.yml`)
  - Resource limits and requests configuration
  - Liveness and readiness probes
  - Security contexts and non-root execution

#### 6. Database Backup and Recovery Procedures
- **Backup Scripts** (`scripts/`)
  - `backup-database.sh` - Automated PostgreSQL backup with compression
  - `restore-database.sh` - Database restoration with validation
  - `backup-cron.sh` - Cron job management for scheduled backups
  - Backup verification and integrity checks
  - Retention policies and cleanup procedures
  - Point-in-time recovery information

#### 7. Monitoring Stack Configuration
- **Prometheus Configuration** (`monitoring/prometheus.yml`)
  - Service discovery for all application components
  - Scraping configuration for metrics collection
  - Alert rules for performance and availability monitoring

- **Alert Rules** (`monitoring/alert_rules.yml`)
  - Application health and performance alerts
  - Database and cache monitoring alerts
  - System resource utilization alerts
  - Configurable thresholds and notification channels

- **Docker Compose Monitoring** (`monitoring/docker-compose.monitoring.yml`)
  - Complete monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager)
  - Log aggregation with Loki and Promtail
  - System metrics with Node Exporter
  - Database and Redis exporters

### ðŸ”§ Integration Points

#### Backend Integration
- Monitoring middleware integrated into Express app (`backend/src/index.ts`)
- Health check routes mounted at root level
- Structured logging for all requests and errors
- Performance metrics collection for all API endpoints

#### Package Scripts
- `npm run monitoring:up` - Start monitoring stack
- `npm run monitoring:down` - Stop monitoring stack
- `npm run backup:db` - Manual database backup
- `npm run backup:setup` - Install automated backup cron job
