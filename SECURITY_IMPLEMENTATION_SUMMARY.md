### Database Setup
Run the security migration to create required tables:
```bash
npm run migrate
```

## Usage Examples

### Enable MFA for User
```typescript
// Setup MFA
const setup = await MFAService.generateTOTPSetup(userId, userEmail);

// Enable MFA with verification
await MFAService.enableMFA(
  userId,
  'My Phone',
  'totp',
  setup.secret,
  verificationCode
);
```

### Record GDPR Consent
```typescript
await GDPRService.recordConsent({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  consentType: 'marketing',
  consentGiven: true,
  consentMethod: 'explicit'
}, req);
```

### Log Security Event
```typescript
await AuditService.logSecurityEvent(
  'suspicious_activity',
  req,
  'high',
  { reason: 'Multiple failed login attempts' }
);
```

## Security Monitoring

The implementation provides comprehensive security monitoring through:

1. **Audit Logs** - All security events are logged with context
2. **Security Alerts** - High-severity events trigger alerts
3. **Rate Limit Monitoring** - Track and alert on rate limit violations
4. **GDPR Compliance Tracking** - Monitor data requests and compliance
5. **MFA Usage Analytics** - Track authentication method usage
