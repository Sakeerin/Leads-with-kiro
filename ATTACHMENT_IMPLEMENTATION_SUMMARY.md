## Security Features

### 1. File Validation
- **Size Limits**: 50MB per file
- **Type Restrictions**: Whitelist of allowed MIME types
- **Extension Validation**: Prevents dangerous file types
- **Content Scanning**: Virus detection before storage

### 2. Access Control
- **Role-Based Permissions**:
  - Admin: Full access (view, download, delete)
  - Manager: View, download, delete
  - Sales/Marketing: View, download only
  - Read-only: View only
- **Lead Assignment**: Users can only access files for assigned leads
- **Audit Trail**: All file operations logged

### 3. Virus Protection
- **Real-time Scanning**: Files scanned on upload
- **Multiple Engines**: Support for ClamAV, VirusTotal
- **Quarantine**: Infected files blocked from download
- **Security Alerts**: Notifications for detected threats

## Storage Architecture

### 1. Cloud Storage (S3)
- **Scalable**: Handles large file volumes
- **Secure**: Encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Cost-effective**: Pay-per-use model
- **Compatible**: Works with AWS S3, MinIO, etc.

### 2. File Organization
- **Structure**: `leads/{leadId}/{timestamp}-{filename}`
- **Deduplication**: Hash-based duplicate detection
- **Versioning**: Maintains file history
- **Cleanup**: Automated removal of deleted files

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Storage Configuration
FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3
