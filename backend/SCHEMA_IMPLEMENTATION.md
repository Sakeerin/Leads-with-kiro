# Database Schema Implementation Summary

## Task 2: Core Data Models and Database Schema - COMPLETED ✅

This document summarizes the implementation of the core data models and database schema for the Lead Management System.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. TypeScript Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)
- **Core Entities**: Lead, User, Task, Activity, AssignmentRule
- **Database Table Interfaces**: LeadTable, UserTable, TaskTable, ActivityTable, AssignmentRuleTable
- **Comprehensive Enums**: LeadStatus, UserRole, TaskType, Priority, ActivityType, LeadChannel, ScoreBand, etc.
- **Supporting Types**: UTMParameters, Reminder, WorkingHours, Territory, RuleCondition, RuleAction

### 2. Database Configuration (`src/config/database.ts`)
- **Knex.js Integration**: Configured for PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Environment Support**: Development, test, and production configurations
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized pool sizes for each environment
- **Migration Support**: Configured migration and seed directories

### 3. Database Migrations (`migrations/`)
Created 6 comprehensive migration files:
- `create_users_table.js` - User accounts and authentication
- `create_companies_table.js` - Company information for deduplication
- `create_leads_table.js` - Core lead data with all required fields
- `create_tasks_table.js` - Task management and follow-ups
- `create_activities_table.js` - Activity logging and audit trail
- `create_assignment_rules_table.js` - Lead routing and assignment rules

### 4. Model Classes (`src/models/`)
Implemented comprehensive model classes with:

#### BaseModel (`BaseModel.ts`)
- **CRUD Operations**: findById, findAll, create, update, delete, softDelete
- **Pagination**: Built-in pagination support
- **Query Builder**: Knex.js query builder integration

#### User Model (`User.ts`)
- **Authentication**: Password hashing with bcrypt
- **Role Management**: Support for Admin, Manager, Sales, Marketing, Read-only, Guest roles
- **Profile Management**: Working hours, territory, department tracking
- **Security**: Password verification and last login tracking

#### Lead Model (`Lead.ts`)
- **Lead Lifecycle**: Complete lead management from creation to conversion
- **Auto-ID Generation**: AL-YY-MM-XXX format account lead IDs
- **Duplicate Detection**: Email, phone, and company name matching
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across multiple fields
- **Scoring Integration**: Lead scoring and band management

#### Task Model (`Task.ts`)
- **Task Management**: Due dates, priorities, assignments, reminders
- **Status Tracking**: Pending, in-progress, completed, cancelled
- **Statistics**: Task completion metrics and overdue tracking
- **Lead Integration**: Tasks linked to specific leads

#### Activity Model (`Activity.ts`)
- **Audit Trail**: Complete activity logging for all lead interactions
- **Activity Types**: 14 different activity types (lead_created, email_sent, etc.)
- **Timeline Support**: Chronological activity feeds
- **Statistics**: Activity metrics and reporting

#### AssignmentRule Model (`AssignmentRule.ts`)
- **Rule Engine**: Configurable conditions and actions
- **Priority System**: Rule ordering and execution
- **Condition Evaluation**: Support for multiple operators (equals, contains, etc.)
- **Territory Support**: Geographic and organizational routing

### 5. Database Schema Features

#### Core Tables Structure
- **users**: User accounts with role-based access control
- **companies**: Normalized company data for deduplication
- **leads**: Comprehensive lead data with all required fields from requirements
- **tasks**: Task management with due dates and reminders
- **activities**: Complete audit trail for all interactions
- **assignment_rules**: Configurable lead routing rules

#### Key Features
- **UUID Primary Keys**: All tables use UUID for better scalability
- **Soft Deletes**: Data retention through is_active flags
- **Audit Trails**: Created/updated timestamps and user tracking
- **JSON Fields**: Flexible storage for custom fields and complex data
- **Indexes**: Optimized indexes for common query patterns
- **Foreign Keys**: Proper relationships with cascade deletes where appropriate

### 6. Validation and Testing
- **Schema Validation**: Comprehensive validation script to verify implementation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with strict type checking
- **Migration Verification**: All migration files created and structured correctly

## Requirements Coverage

This implementation addresses the following requirements:

### Requirement 1.1 (Lead Capture and Creation)
✅ Complete lead data model with all required fields
✅ Auto-generated Account Lead ID in AL-YY-MM-XXX format
✅ Support for all lead sources and channels
✅ Custom fields support through JSON storage

### Requirement 2.1 (Lead Management and Data Operations)
✅ Full CRUD operations with audit trails
✅ Soft delete functionality
✅ Activity logging for all changes
✅ Bulk operations support through base model

### Requirement 6.1 (Task Management and Activity Tracking)
✅ Complete task management system
✅ Activity logging for all lead interactions
✅ Timeline support with chronological ordering
✅ Task completion tracking and statistics

### Requirement 9.1 (Lead Conversion and Handover)
✅ Lead status management for conversion tracking
✅ Activity trail preservation
✅ Data model supports conversion workflows

## Database Connection and Pooling

- **Connection Pooling**: Configured with appropriate pool sizes
  - Development: 2-10 connections
  - Test: 1-5 connections  
  - Production: 2-10 connections
- **Environment Support**: Separate configurations for dev/test/prod
- **Error Handling**: Proper connection error handling and recovery

## Next Steps

1. **Start Database**: `docker-compose up -d postgres`
2. **Run Migrations**: `npm run migrate:latest`
3. **Seed Data**: `npm run seed:run` (when seed files are created)
4. **Test Connection**: Verify database connectivity
5. **Begin Service Implementation**: Move to task 3 (Authentication system)
