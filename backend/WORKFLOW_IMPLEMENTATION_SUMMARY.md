- Supports follow-up task creation and notifications
- Integrated into TaskService.completeTask()

### 6. Manual Trigger (`manual`)
- User-initiated workflow execution
- Supports ad-hoc automation and testing
- Available through API endpoints

## Advanced Features

### 1. Conditional Logic
- Complex condition evaluation with field-based rules
- Support for equals, not_equals, contains, greater_than, less_than, in, not_in operators
